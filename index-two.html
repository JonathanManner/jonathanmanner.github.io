            <h2>Developer, enthusiast</h2>
            <p>I've always been interested in technology. While I have been
                in the recycling business the last 11 years, lately I've picked
                up web developing in my spare time, I have gained interest in the 
                world of front end developing and been learning languages/frameworks
                like: Javascript, nodeJS, HTML, CSS, ReactJS and ReactNative.
                I've learned that these concepts have given me power to create and
                invent, but also that there is a lot left for me to explore.

                Please take a look around to see what <span>I've been working on</span>, my
                <span>projects</span> and what <span>I've written.</span>
