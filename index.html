            <h3>I aspire to become a front end developer.</h3>
            <p>Having been in the recycling business for the last eleven years has made me realise that I<br>
            want to try something different, something that really has been an interest of mine for quite<br> 
            a long time, which is programming. <br>
            I studied c++ in high school but it never stuck with me back then.<br>
            This will probably become some sort of interactive CV, where I will be adding features as I progress<br>
            through my education. Which will mainly consist of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>React JS</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </body>
